## About

This is a classification project on a raw dataset containing different features about ads displayed on websites and their final labels determining whether the ad lead to a purchase or not. First we did EDA on the raw dataset and got rid of so much useless information. Then we tested different ML approaches, linear and non-linear, such as XGBOOST, simple neural network with automatic tuning and RandomForest on our cleaned dataset. We achieved and F1 score of approximately 0.49 on the neural network and 0.5 on RandomForest.

## Run

Feel free to upload our notebook on colab and play with it.

## Note

We belive that a major bottleneck in achieving higher f1 score was lack of useful dataset. This dataset had many useless columns and null values.
